# AI-Driven Metasploit Control System

**Automate penetration testing with natural language commands using Gemini AI and Metasploit**

## üîç Overview

This project integrates Google's Gemini AI with Metasploit Framework to create an intelligent penetration testing system that:
- Translates natural language instructions into actionable attack sequences
- Automates target scanning with Nmap
- Executes exploits through Metasploit's RPC interface
- Establishes Meterpreter sessions automatically

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Describe your attack in plain English (e.g., "Scan 192.168.1.0/24 and exploit EternalBlue")
- **AI-Powered Planning**: Gemini AI generates structured JSON attack plans
- **Automated Workflow**: From scanning to exploitation in one seamless process
- **Interactive CLI**: Real-time control and monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This tool is intended for **legal security testing and educational purposes only**. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any penetration testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed installation and configuration instructions.
